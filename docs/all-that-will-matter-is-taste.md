# All That Will Matter Is Taste

Over the next few years, the way we write code and build software products will shift dramatically. Large Language Models, and by extension agents, are becoming increasingly more capable. Soon enough the barrier to creating whatever interface or application one can imagine won't be technical ability. The only differentiator will be taste.

What happens when creating applications isn't a matter of technical ability? And every idea guy has a swarm of developers available at his fingertips? What will differentiate products and software in the marketplace? It's taste. No one wants to read AI written articles, no one wants to look at your AI art. Until we can create models that truely synthesise completely new ideas, the best we have is taste.

It will be the responsibility of the builder to interface as closely as possible with their swarm of agents to guide the product. The product owner will steer the ship of agents in the way he wants using his own inspiration and taste. The inspired builder will be able to effortlessly realise his vision for whatever he decides to craft. What will make his product unique is the cumulation of signal that he has been able to pass through to his swarm of agents. No spending hours wrestling with React - just taste realised instantly.
